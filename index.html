                <p>
                    As I mentioned before I am Ricky Medina, I am an 18 year-old aspiring coder.
                    I grew my passion for coding back at my high school in my coding classes.
                    As you go on in my webpage, you'll notice that I am still working on polishing and refining my skills as a coder.
                    I intend to become a successful coder in my future, but for now, I am taking a bootcamp course from the University of Utah to enchance my abilities as a coder.
